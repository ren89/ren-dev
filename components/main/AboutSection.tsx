          I’m a developer passionate about creating websites and mobile apps,
          driven by a love for coding since high school. I focus on continuous
          learning, helping others, and building features that make a

          Ever since high school, I’ve dreamed of making my own game, sparked by
          my passion for playing them. This passion led me to pursue a
          Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. Along the way, I
          discovered my love for creating websites and mobile apps, and found
          satisfaction in developing new features.

          Fast-forward to today, in my professional journey, my love for coding
          has only grown—especially when I see people using the features I’ve
          built.
